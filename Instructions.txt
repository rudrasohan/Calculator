Instructions for usage

1->QUICK MODE

you can write expressions like
2+2*8-9+7
7-8/2*6

(limitation is brackets. Expressions like 2+2*(2+6) will give wrong answer)

2->BASIC MODE

 printf("press _ to just enter\n");
    printf("press + to add\n");
    printf("press - to subtract\n");
    printf("press * to multiply\n");
    printf("press / to divide\n");
    printf("press a for sin(x)\n");
    printf("press b for cos(x)\n");
    printf("press c for tan(x)\n");
    printf("press d for asin(x)\n");
    printf("press e for acos(x)\n");
    printf("press f for atan(x)\n");
    printf("press g for sinh(x)\n");
    printf("press h for cosh(x)\n");
    printf("press i for tanh(x)\n");
    printf("press j for exp(x)\n");
    printf("press k for log(x)\n");
    printf("press l for log10(x)\n");
    printf("press m for pow(x,y)\n");
    printf("press n for sqrt(x)\n");
    printf("\nPress q to Quit\n");
    
    if you want to input a value normally then press _ or if you want to to directly use functions like sin or cos etc
    then you can call the  appropriate functions.
    
    program will also ask that if you want to use a new value or use the previous result. 
    
    the program will ask how you want to use this value to the result.
    Using _ will make the current entered value as the result.
    
    Eg - (a typical execution (cos(5+sin(85(in radians))))
    Enter the choice of function
_

Press y to use the previous result or press n to give new value
n

Enter the value
5
5.000000
Enter the way by which you want to use this number in your result
_
5.000000

Enter the choice of function
a

Press y to use the previous result or press n to give new value
n

Enter the value
85
-0.176076
Enter the way by which you want to use this number in your result
+
4.823925

Enter the choice of function
b

Press y to use the previous result or press n to give new value
y
0.111304
Enter the way by which you want to use this number in your result
_
0.111304

Enter the choice of function
q

limitation(It is quite complex to use)

3-> MATRIX MODE

normal

limitation - result only appears after you give the quit command

4->COMPLEX MODE

normal

gives polar form in degrees
